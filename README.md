Firstly, its my first open source code. :) And there may be lots of exceptions and errors. sorry about that. But i share this project because of MyService.Java class. I was read lots of documentation and couldnt handle with sending notification intime. The solution that i found is adding a parser into service class. 
I hope It would be helpfull for you. 

PS: it was mobile app lesson project.


At the ApplicationData class there is comment to direct you to get instagrams dev page to get keys.
